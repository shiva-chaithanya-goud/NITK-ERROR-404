                <p>Between 1750 and 1850, the people of the Mizo tribe came from the nearby Chin Hills, settled here and subjugated the local people. Later, similar tribes united and formed their own society. The Mizo developed an autocratic political system based on 300 hereditary heads. The Mizo tribes remained unaffected by any foreign political influence, but only until the British annexed Assam under the Yandabo Treaty in 1826. After the British rule in 1891, the Lushai mountainous region of North under Assam and half the southern part remained under West Bengal for a few years. In 1898, the two were merged to form a district called 'Lushai Hills district,' which came under the administration of the Chief Commissioner of Assam.  </p>
