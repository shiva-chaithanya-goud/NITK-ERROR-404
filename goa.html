                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>Spending time around the beaches teeming with lush green coconut trees spreading their shadow over the lavishing golden brown sand, with the beautifulview of blue oceanic water, is not a bad idea to make the best out of your holidays and that too is possible within India, in Goa. Goa is visited by large numbers of international and domestic tourists each year for its beaches, places of worship and world heritage architecture. It also has rich flora and fauna, owing to its location on the Western Ghats range, which is classified as a biodiversity hotspot.
                    </p>
                    <p>The state of Goa is divided into three sections: North, Central and South Goa, each has its own importance.The Western Ghats, which form most of eastern Goa, have been internationally recognized as one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. Goa's wildlife sanctuaries boast of more than 1512 documented species of plants, over 275 species of birds, around 48 kinds of animals and more than 60 genera of reptiles.Goa is India's richest state with a GDP per capita two and a half times that of the country as a whole.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>The history of Goa has been showered through a drizzling array of rulers from Ashoka’s Mauryan empire in the 3rd century BC to the long-ruling Kadambas in 1054 AD; from the Muslim Delhi Sultanate to Bahamani Sultanate and then the arrival of Portuguese in 1510 who remained in existence for about 450 years. The Portuguese resisted India’s 1947 independence from Britain and it was not until 1961 when the Indian army marched into Goa, then after almost five centuries of Portuguese occupation finally came to an end in the subcontinent. </p>

                <h3>Culture</h3>
                <p>The culture of Goa is an amalgamation of Indian and Portuguese culture. The long Portuguese rule has influenced the culture in more ways than one and many of the Portuguese traditions are reflected in the Goan culture even today. Dance and music is deeply embedded in the Goan culture. The most popular dance forms in Goa are Fugdi and Dhalo, which are traditional dances, performed only by women. Some dances are specific to an occasion or festival they are performed in.  
                </p>
                <p> The Government of Goa has taken additional steps to further the handicrafts industry in Goa and has set up the Goa Handicrafts Rural and Small Scale Industries Development Corporation (GHRSSIDC) that has provided employment to many craftsmen.

                    <h3>Food and Cuizine</h3>
                    <p>The cuisine of Goa is a delicious reflection of its history and heritage. It is influenced by its Hindu origins, four hundred years of Portuguese colonialism, and modern techniques. No other cuisine in India can claim such contrasting influences. Seafood, coconut milk, rice, and local spices are main ingredients of Goan cuisine. Being a state with a tropical climate, the spices and flavours are intense. Use of kokum is another distinct feature. Kingfish (Vison or Visvan) is the most common delicacy. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Others include Pomfret, Shark, Tuna and Mackerel. Among the shellfish are Crabs, Prawns, Tiger Prawns, Lobster, Squid and Mussels. The Portuguese have had a pronounced influence on Goan cuisine. They introduced Potatoes, Tomatoes, Pineapples, Guavas and Cashews. But the most significant contribution is the introduction of the spicy Peri-Peri Chilli, which is the most important part of Goan spices.
