<h2>Introduction:</h2>

Culture and Heritage provide varieties of tourist attractions. For these reasons, they are core components of tourism. The glorious past of India has ensured that the present and subsequent generations have plenty of historical, cultural, and natural heritage to be proud of. The fascinating monuments and heritage sites in the country stand quietly today to tell their story of joy, sorrow, courage, and sacrifice. Each of the stories is so enchanting and singular that tourists will be left asking for more at the end of each narration. It is interesting to note that in the 10th century the Arabs described Indian culture as Ajaib-ul-Hind means ‘Incredible India.’
The Culture of India refers to the way of life of the people of India. India’s languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food, and customs differ from place to place within the country. The Indian culture is often labeled as an amalgamation of several segments of cultures, including several millennia-old traditions. In its collective form, these cultural traits are identified as Indian cultural heritage. What we inherited from our predecessors is known as heritage. Thus heritage encompasses the history and ideas of the people of that country, their values and beliefs, monuments, and sites of important past events which are historically famous. Besides, in the category of heritage, we can include arts such as dance, and music.
In this project, we aim towards exhibiting the diversity of Indian Culture and Heritage. This website is created so that anyone can have an easy understanding of this vast Indian Culture and Heritage. If one wants to plan a trip to any Indian state and want a simple mini-review of the overall state, this is the perfect website to find everything about the state.
 
<h2>Next for this project / Our Future Endeavors:</h2>

This can be developed as a travel planning model. By setting up a travel itinerary, we can customize the travel plan for the users. Also by collaborating with travel sites and travel bloggers, we can turn this into a business model.
Our primary source of income would be from users booking their dream, and destinations, and our secondary source of income would be from AdVert when our site will have decent traffic.
We also plan to add an E-Commerce platform to support Local Indian handcrafts, items, and more specifically Indian-made products.
