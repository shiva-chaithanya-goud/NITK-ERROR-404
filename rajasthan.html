                <p>The history of Rajasthan begins from prehistoric times. The culture of the state was similar to the Indus Valley Civilization between 3000 and 1000 BC. Gujjars, also known as Gurjar, Goojar, or Gojar, ruled most of Rajasthan until the 12th century. Most parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan were known as 'Gurjatra,' i.e., 'Gujjar-protected areas.' Gurjara-Pratiharas had saved entire northern India from Arab invasions for 300 years. Later, Rajputs took suzerainty over various parts of this state, and those areas known as 'Rajputana,' i.e., 'place of Rajputs' in the British period. Rajasthan was ruled by many great Rajput rulers such as Bappa Rawal, Rana Kumbha, Rana Sanga, and Rana Pratap. Mewar was the most prominent and powerful state of Rajasthan in the medieval period.</p>
                <p>The average of Rajasthan in summers varies from 25°C to 46°C and 8°C to 28°C in winters. The average rainfall also varies from the western desert to the southeast part of the state which is about 100 mm and 650 mm annually. Most of the rain falls during the monsoon from July to September.</p>
